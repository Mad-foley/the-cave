But we did get the authentication working and implemented the the authentication check on our wine object queries.

Today we worked through the API endpoints for the user models.  We worked through the code together and figured out how to get the endpoints working and sending the proper responses.  We did some trouble-shooting with docker for Maddy and Scott because apparently the new apple M1 and M2 chips have issues with dealing with cross-platform projects. I'm feeling less intimidated by FastAPI after today.

## 2/10/23

We finalized our wireframing and studied FastAPI through the docs and videos on learn. We also spent some time team-building and getting to know each other better.

We worked on finalizing the wireframing and discussed whether we should handle like count on the front-end or back-end. We decided to use a count variable as part of the wine entity. We also finalized a draft of our api-design.
