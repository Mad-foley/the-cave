In the afternoon we pairprogrammed as a group of 4 bouncing ideas off of eachother. Malcolm shared his screen and wrote code while we worked collbartively to develop and debug the CRUD user Apis.

I had a minor bug with docker failing to connect to postgresql, which according to stack overflow is a common bug for Mac's with an M1 chip. I was able to find a line of code from stackoverflow I have to run before building images.

In the Evening I shared screens so we all pairprogrammed together to fix some merge conflicts and refactor code.

Today we finalized out wireframming and felt confident about our project starting point. We studied FastAPI's, postgreSQL and Authentication together and tossed new ideas.



## Feb 9, 2023 (start of journaling):

We collaborated togther to create our repository, finish our wire-framing and designed our APIs. We ensured we are on the same page about the development process and discussed what changes and potential features we would like to make.
