## Feb 9, 2023 (start of journaling):

We collaborated togther to create our repository, finish our wire-framing and designed our APIs. We ensured we are on the same page about the development process and discussed what changes and potential features we would like to make.

## Feb 10, 2023:

Today we finalized out wireframming and felt confident about our project starting point. We studied FastAPI's, postgreSQL and Authentication together and tossed new ideas.

## Feb 13, 2023:

In the afternoon we pairprogrammed as a group of 4 bouncing ideas off of eachother. Malcolm shared his screen and wrote code while we worked collbartively to develop and debug the CRUD user Apis.

I had a minor bug with docker failing to connect to postgresql, which according to stack overflow is a common bug for Mac's with an M1 chip. I was able to find a line of code from stackoverflow I have to run before building images.

In the Evening I shared screens so we all pairprogrammd together to fix some merge conflicts and refactor code.
